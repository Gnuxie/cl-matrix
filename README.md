## Hello World!
Here is a hello world example

```

(defvar *user-one* (cl-matrix:login "@me:myhomeserver" "******"))

(cl-matrix:with-account (*user-one*)
  (cl-matrix:msg-send "hello world!" "!someRoomId:matrix.org"))
```

## What is supported?
At the moment most apis are usable

There is an example of event listening on account-sync,
I'm still unsure if this should be a part of the library since it's simple to setup and you might want to use an event framework different to deeds.

## Why did you make this?
I made this so I could write my own bots and tools for matrix, I am planning on sharing them as soon as this library has a release since most of them rely on it one change in this repo is going to break the others.

I have tried to make this as extensible as possible.
