## Hello World!
Here is a hello world example

```

(defvar *user-one* (cl-matrix:make-account "@my-username:my-homeserver" "******"))

(cl-matrix:with-account (*user-one*)
  (cl-matrix:msg-send "hello world!" "!someRoomId:matrix.org"))
```

## What is supported?
At the moment most apis are usable and there are classes for accounts and rooms

There is now also event listening and I will be writing more documentation on this shortly.

event listening is changeing again. I'm going to use deeds.

## Why did you make this?
I made this so I could write my own bots and tools for matrix, I am planning on sharing them as soon as this library has a release since most of them rely on it one change in this repo is going to break the others.

I have tried to make this as extensible as possible.

## What can I expect this to become?
I am now changing some of the fundamental parts of the library and doing them a better way for example
I'm not longer keeping any state about rooms in the client as I've found a work around for the behavoir i wanted.
