# CL-MATRIX
cl-matrix is a WIP client library for [matrix](https://matrix.org)

Reference index generated by staple can be viewed [here](https://gnuxie.gitlab.io/cl-matrix). This can also be generated by running generate-docs.

## Hello World!
Here is a hello world example

```

(let ((user (cl-matrix:login "@me:myhomeserver" "******")))
  (cl-matrix:msg-send user "hello world!" "!someRoomId:matrix.org"))
```

## What is supported?
The entire client-server api is accessible from `cl-matrix.api.client` and
`cl-matrix.api.media`, both of these are generated.
The name transforms go something like this
`/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{roomId}/joined_members` ->
`cl-matrix.api.client:rooms/roomid/joined-memebrs` I'm sure you can figure it out.

The package `cl-matrix` provides some nice utilities to use on top of the generated
api that can help with media, pagination, room creation, accounts, sending messages etc.
There's even some examples of how you can listen for events in cl-matrix.base-events

## Project status
This project is still being updated and is usable, changes will be mentioned in the [changelog](https://gitlab.com/Gnuxie/cl-matrix/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). I am also still using this for various experiments that I do hope to be able to show as examples soon.

Previous versions have also been [tagged](https://gitlab.com/Gnuxie/cl-matrix/-/tags).
